# outline

- how i got started with quartodoc
    - goldilocks syndrome
    - makedocs's bed was too soft: felt nice, but unable to do the things to give user's the documentation you need (API documentation)
    - sphinx's bed was too hard: not ergonomic, difficult to get going, feels like you have to be a sphinx developer to write sphinx docs, who even wants to write rst ðŸ˜©
    - quartodoc just right: builds API docs to put inside a quarto site
- developer wins
    - quick to get started
    - built off quarto, extensible as packages grow and easy to use
    - maintainable, literate config
- user wins
    - pkgdown is well loved in R community bc of its predictability & straightforward structure
    - built in accessibility due to quarto build
- walkthrough of config file
- show sites made in quartodoc

## other pieces

- R vs. Python docs
    - R has emphasis on longer form documentation (vignettes)
    - Python often just API

# impact/effect

- empower developers to try out quartodoc -> make documentation better for pydata community
