::: notes
there's of course-- many ways to talk about documentation. you can learn how to write accessible explanations to technical terms, how to build reproducible examples...

i am a open source software engineer at posit, and that role makes me think of everything...but especially documentation as a tooling problem.
the R ecosytem has a well loved tool -- pkgdown is a tool used to scaffold documentation, and it is massively loved in R community bc of its predictability & straightforward structure. if youre in the R world, you might not even realize all the benefits you have 

users benefit from package down since there is a predictable structure: landing page, reference, articles, news, and maybe a getting started. developers can make a packagedown site in literally less than 1 minute (and if you dont beleive me, you can rewatch jenny bryan's talk from this afternoon on youtube).

# {background-image="images/intro_oh_no.png"}

::: notes
i have to say, in contrast to the well-engineered, straightforward choice in R, the python world feels like the wild west. when i started building the package vetiver, i really struggled to find a tool that felt that felt just right to create documentation websites.
:::

# {background-image="images/goldidocs.png"}

::: notes
in fact, i felt a bit like goldilocks...
:::

# {background-image="images/house_woods.png"}

::: notes
if you're not familiar with the tale, goldilocks is a children's story of a young girl who is lost in the woods and finds a house where no one is home, walks in, and starts messing with the homeowners stuff.
:::

# {background-image="images/cold_porridge.png"}

::: notes
 she is hungry and tries out 3 bowls of porridge that are set out on the table: the first one is freezing cold
:::

# {background-image="images/hot_porridge.png"}

::: notes
the next is scorching hot,
:::

# {background-image="images/love_porridge.png"}

::: notes
and the last is just right
:::

# {background-image="images/love_bears.png"}

::: notes
she ends up messing around with a bunch of other stuff in this house and then some HOMEOWNING BEARS come in and she realizes it was bears that inhabited the home, but they ... 
:::

# {background-image="images/fear_bears.png"}

::: notes
allegedly live happily ever after.

while goldilocks legally might have been breaking and entering, we're going to view this tale with the child-like lens where goldilocks has entered a strange new place and she believes this world has been made for her, but she often feels frustrated because **she knows what she wants**, but oftentimes nothing feels _just right_.

when i started making my first docs site, i felt this frustration of knowing what i wanted in my docs-- i wanted a maintainable, markdown based documentation system that would give usesrs all the information they needed to be successful! but the tools at hand not feeling just right
:::

# long format docs

::: r-fit-text
..._when and why_ to run the code
:::

::: notes
i knew i wanted long format documentation

the r world has this down to a science, in fact, they have a name (vignettes)
and vignettes are great for a telling a story, giving context to a small workflow your package can help with! 
::: 

## mkdocs 

![](images/long-format-2.png)
![](images/goldidocs_clear.png){.absolute bottom=0 right=50 height="100"}

::: notes
so i tried a tool built for long format documentation called mkdocs. it was great to get started, and i was able write in markdown, which was exactly what i wanted! but i realized, users cannot live on vignettes alone.... were fantastically prepared to know WHEN, but not HOW to use the vetiver package. they needed something else too--not just long format

this documentation tool was not just right, it was way too much information for users
:::

# function reference

::: r-fit-text
..._how_ to run code
:::

## function reference

![](images/docstring.png)

::: notes
okay, so in python, when you write out source code for packages, you write something called a docstring. these are available so users can see in your code how to use your functions! 

and theres special ways to format them-- you can see here i have indented stuff in a special way, done some special triple quotation marks, whatnot.
:::

## function reference

![](images/sphinx_annotated_api.png)

::: notes
i knew there were tools out there that could progrmmatically export this information to a beautiful website page, called a function reference (or api documentation, referring to the fact it is documenting your packages API)

and i found a tool for just this, called sphinx!!! it took my code, and spit out restructured text
:::

## function reference

![](images/vetiver_sphinx_index.png)
![](images/goldidocs_clear.png){.absolute bottom=0 right=50 height="250"}

::: notes
but in true goldilocks...maybe goldiDOCS fashion...this function reference alone was not just right-- API docs were not enough. while sphinx did allow for me to have what i needed for the generated website, i really wanted to have a markdown based site, not restructured text, and i didn't want to continue to wrangle all the extensions i had to add on to make the website i had. for this goldilocks and this project, sphinx was not enough.

so my quest for the just right docs framework continued.

add in what you would like to document

if you add a class, all the methods and attributes are autodocumented on each page, but you can also split it out like i did for Goldilocks class here

## little bit of configuration

these 17 lines of configuration will generate a site that will include this reference page

## website built with quarto

::: incremental
- generates `.qmd` files as reference pages
- accessibility built in
- extensible as packages grow
:::

::: notes
able to write in markdown

quarto able to grow from 1 page to large sites

comes with high contrast highlighting, accessible sizing, and easily customizable alt text for images etc
:::

## extensibility

![](images/ibis.png)

::: notes
and to really highlight extensibility--a project called ibis just moved from mkdocs to quartodoc, you can see here they've added some custom code formatting and really fun table highlighting. this was something they developed inside of quartodoc to be able to customize their docs to be JUST RIGHT for them!

# user wins



## predictable

::: notes
- highlighted things
- story of R -> Python

quartodoc starts users off with an outline that makes things easy to find, allowing developers to worry about content, not how to set up their site

# {background-image="images/love_porridge.png"}

::: notes
i have been a delighted user of quartodoc. i have to say a heartfelt thank you michael chow from the quarto team at posit who has done all this amazing work to make my life easier i was the first user of quartodoc and worked closely with michael to get the vetiver site up and running. 

goldilocks, in our lens, is a hospitality story-- where goldilocks was lost, she found a home in quartodoc that felt just right.
