When Python package developers create documentation, they typically must choose between mostly auto-generated docs or writing all the docs by hand. This is problematic since effective documentation has a mix of function references, high-level context, examples, and other content.

[Quartodoc](https://machow.github.io/quartodoc/get-started/overview.html) is a new documentation system that automatically generates Python function references within Quarto websites. This talk will discuss pkgdown's success in the R ecosystem and how those wins can be replicated in Python with quartodoc examples. Listeners will walk away knowing more about what makes documentation delightful (or painful), when to use quartodoc, and how to use this tool to make docs for a Python package.
